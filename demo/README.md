# Local Demo & Development Guide

This directory contains the assets and configuration required to run the AIM ecosystem in a fully isolated local environment. It simulates Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery for end-to-end development without cloud credentials.

## 📂 Directory Structure

- `config/`: Source of truth for local job configuration.
    - `aim-config.json`: Persisted parameters from the UI.
- `runlist/`: Input data for the "Global Priority" mode.
    - `priority_runlist_current.csv`: A sample list of vehicles and sizes ranked by priority.
- `output/`: Results generated by the Growth Job.
    - `results_<run_id>.csv`: Final ranked SKUs per vehicle.
    - `job_status.json`: The authoritative state file polled by the UI.
- `logs/`: Diagnostic information.
    - `job.log`: Combined stdout/stderr from the Growth Job subprocess.
    - `requests_global_*.jsonl`: Trace logs of raw JSON payloads sent to Waves.

## 🚀 How to Run the Demo

### Windows (PowerShell)
1.  Open a terminal in the project root.
2.  Execute the orchestration script:
    ```powershell
    ./run_demo.ps1
    ```
    *This script will automatically free ports 5000, 8081, and 5173 before launching.*

### Troubleshooting
- **Port Conflict**: If the script fails to start a component, ensure no hidden processes are holding the ports. The `run_demo.ps1` script includes a "Nuclear Cleanup" logic to handle this automatically.
- **Job Errors**: If a run fails, check `demo/logs/job.log` for Python tracebacks.
- **UI 500 Errors**: The API server includes retry-logic for Windows file locks, but ensure you aren't manually editing `job_status.json` while a job is running.

## 🛠 Adding New Test Data

To test specific vehicle combinations, simply edit `demo/runlist/priority_runlist_current.csv`. Ensure the column headers (`Vehicle`, `Size`, `PriorityRank`) remain intact.
